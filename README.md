# CS4311-NTPS

### Dependencies:
1. Python3 (tested on python 3.6)
2. Scapy for packet sniffing (tested 2.4)

### How to install scapy in python3
`pip install --pre scapy[complete]` (make sure that pip is not installing scapy to python2.7, if multiple versions of python exist in the system)

### How to run
1. Open a terminal and change directory to the directory where ntps_gui.py is downloaded.
2. Run `sudo python ntps_gui.py` (sudo is required to allow sniffing packet using scapy)
